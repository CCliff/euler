# Project Euler Exercises

## The Exercises
All exercises can be found on https://projecteuler.net/

## The Structure
I have this repo set up as a series of folders, one for each exercise.

The folder should be the number of the exercise. The files contained will hold the solution. I am currently writing it all in Node for ease of use, but do what you want.
